"Web3 represents a paradigm shift that reimagines the very fabric of the internet," said British MP Natalie Elphicke.

```
“Web3代表了一种范式转变，重新构想了互联网的本质，”英国议员娜塔莉·埃尔菲克说道。
```

A group of British politicians took to the metaverse to address global leaders in a 51-nation gathering on Sept. 20, setting out a vision for the United Kingdom’s blockchain and Web3 industries.

```
"一群英国政治家于9月20日进入元宇宙，向来自51个国家的全球领导人发表演讲，提出了英国区块链和Web3产业的愿景。"
```

The metaverse gathering saw eight British Lords and politicians address global leaders on the opportunities and challenges posed by the growth of Web3 technology

```
"这次元宇宙聚会看到了八位英国领主和政治家向全球领导人发表演讲，探讨了Web3技术增长所带来的机遇和挑战。"
```

Natalie Elphicke, member of parliament and chair of the new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Blockchain Technologies, appeared as her unique avatar in the metaverse, where she stressed the importance of the next iteration of the internet:

```
"国会议员、新成立的全党国会小组（APPG）区块链技术主席娜塔莉·艾尔菲克在元宇宙中以她独特的头像形象出现，强调了互联网的下一次演进的重要性："

“Web3 represents a paradigm shift that reimagines the very fabric of the internet.”

```
"Web3代表了一种范式转变，重新构想了互联网的本质结构。"
```

In her keynote, Elphicke said that the U.K. has the potential to become a blockchain-enabled “smart country” but noted the nation was “lagging competitors” in securing blockchain-related jobs.

```
在她的主题演讲中，艾尔菲克表示英国有潜力成为一个启用区块链的“智能国家”，但她指出，英国在确保与区块链相关的工作方面“落后于竞争对手”。
```

The first U.K. national priority is Web3 industry growth and workforce planning, she said before adding:

```
她表示，英国的首要国家任务是Web3行业的增长和劳动力规划，然后补充说：
```

“Part of that is about making the U.K. an attractive hub for Web3 founders, developers, programmers and companies to work here.”

```
"其中一部分是要使英国成为Web3创始人、开发人员、程序员和公司愿意在这里工作的吸引力枢纽。"
```

Elphicke called for more national blockchain roadmaps and collaboration between countries, commenting that so far, fewer than 12 countries have published roadmaps.

```
艾尔菲克呼吁制定更多国家级的区块链路线图，并倡导各国之间的合作，她评论说，到目前为止，只有不到12个国家公布了路线图。
```

She said another priority was taking forward the National Blockchain Roadmap, published in 2021. The roadmap sets out an ambition to build a blockchain-based “digital nation,” with the technology being applied to climate mitigation efforts, industrial symbiosis networks and digital identity programs.

```
她表示，另一个优先事项是推进2021年发布的国家区块链路线图。该路线图明确了建立基于区块链的“数字国家”的雄心壮志，该技术将应用于气候缓解工作、产业共生网络和数字身份计划。
```

She also mentioned DeFi, stating that it poses “unique challenges and opportunities for regulators and policymakers,” before adding that “ensuring transparency, auditability, and accountability in these ecosystems is paramount.”

```
她还提到了DeFi，表示它对监管机构和政策制定者提出了“独特的挑战和机遇”，然后补充说，“确保这些生态系统的透明性、可审计性和问责制至关重要。”
```
